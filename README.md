Command Line Pokedex
=======================================

A command line based interface for a full pokedex. It displays the stats for whichever pokemon is searched for along with a ASCII based colored sprite. 

The sprite proved to be very annoying to fit in the nice tabulated format I had setup.

The sprite conversion is from here [here](https://github.com/hit9/img2txt) and the pokemon data is from [here](https://github.com/PokeAPI/pokeapi). I directly grabbed the CSVs instead of using the API because I needed data for all pokemon and this method was quicker.
